# Contributing to Free Datasets
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Start new dataset
- Add new data to already created dataset

## How to add a new dataset

To create a new dataset, create an issue using the issue template and wait for approval. Once approved, you can only create a text dataset (json, csv, xml, etc.), which means no image or video datasets are allowed, because we can make the repository easy to clone. Create a new dataset folder at the root of this project and create a `README.md`. For this `README.md` we recommend adding the following information:
- **Description**: Explain what type of data you are storing
- **Format**: Explain how you structure your dataset, for example: store all data in a `.csv` or separate file.
- **Source(optional)**: If you get the data from another source that you have collected, please explain where you get it from and how you get it. **You can't just download someone else's dataset and upload it**.
- **Example**: Please provide a simple dataset sample.

If you think it's important to add more information to `README.md`, feel free to add it.

**Note: If you add your dataset(s), you agree to share your data publicly and allow people to use it.**

## How to add new data to an already created dataset

The information in the data sets must be created collaboratively. For example, if there is a dataset that stores Age and Weight like the following example:
| age | weight |
| --- | ------ |
| 22  | 78     |
| 25  | 100    |
| 30  | 88     |  

You can collaborate by adding your data. In addition, you should check the `README.md` dataset to see what kind of information the dataset has, how to collaborate, and any important information that the creator deems important for that dataset.

**Note: If you add your data to dataset(s), you agree to share your data publicly and allow people to use it.**

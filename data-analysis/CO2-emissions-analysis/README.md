## What Was The Purpose?
The purpose of this analysis is to use the `CN_CHINA.csv` dataset to get useful information about CO2 emissions in China, during the years 1970-2021.

## How Did You Do It?
All analysis was done using the **R programming language**, and one library called **ggplot2**.

### Running instructions

The R script is found in the `data-analysis/CO2-emissions-analysis` folder.

The only prerequisite to run this is to have R installed, and add the **ggplot2** library:
```R
install.packages(ggplot2)
```

If you have R installed and this package added, you can run it with the command:

```bash
Rscript CO2-analysis-script.R
```



## What Was The Results?

#### Summary
I found that the CO2 emissions in China have been rising over the last several decades. Although it has been steadily increasing, there are no current outliers.  Predicting any future changes, I was able to statistically compute about a 240 megatonne increase in the amount of CO2 emissions yearly, on average.

Based on the research below, China will continue to emit more CO2 each year at a steady rate.


#### Research

##### Total emissions since 1970
![Total Emissions](../CO2-emissions-analysis/CO2-analysis-img/total-emissions.png)


On a surprising note, the kilograms of CO2 emissions per $1000 of GDP has been decreasing.

Regarding any outliers, no particular year produced unusually more or less emissions, seen in the absence of any outliers in the boxplot below.

The mean of the total emissions is 4873.06. However, this is a simple calculation and is actually not the most reliable. Using a t-test in **R**, I was able to calculate that the true mean of total emissions from this sample is actually between 3800.937 and 5945.184.

##### T-test to show true mean
```R
        One Sample t-test

data:  content$co2_total_megatonne
t = 9.125, df = 51, p-value = 2.66e-12
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 3800.937 5945.184
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  4873.06 
```


With regard to the yearly increase of CO2 in China, using a linear model I was able to determine that each year is expected to have about 238.4 megatonnes more CO2.

##### Linear model
```R
Call:
lm(formula = content$co2_total_megatonne ~ content$year)

Coefficients:
 (Intercept)  content$year  
   -470819.0         238.4 
```


The quantile ranges for the data can also be calculated in R

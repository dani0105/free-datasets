# <h1 align="center">Free Datasets</h1> 
<br>

We are trying to create a news dataset. So you will need to generate scraper code or any way to get **Real Data** (We are not looking for easy PR). We hope that this repository will help people doing machine learning or data mining projects.

You can contribute to this project by adding a new dataset, add new records or do data analysis <br>
